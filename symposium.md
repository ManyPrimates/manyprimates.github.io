## In progress

We are planning for the first ManyPrimates symposium to take place sometime after the pandemic at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

Our plan is to bring people together to discuss the state of the project more broadly but also actively work on procedures, analyzes, writing, etc. for ongoing ManyPrimates projects. The symposium will include two keynote talks and plenty of time for workshops and discussions to improve methodologies, and a poster session where you can showcase your own research.

Check back here again later for more information!
