## In progress

The second ManyPrimates project will assess primates' ability to resist the temptation of an immediate reward in order to receive a larger or better reward later on. We have assembled a coordination team, have drafted the data collection procedures, and are currently working on submitting a registered report for this study. If you are interested in joining the project, please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
