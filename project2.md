## In progress

The second ManyPrimates project will assess primates' ability to resist the temptation of an immediate reward in order to receive a larger or better reward later on. We are getting ready to start data collection for this study. If you are interested in joining the project, please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}) and watch this space for more information!
