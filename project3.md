## In progress

The third ManyPrimates project will assess primates' ability to make choices by excluding alternative options. We have assembled a coordination team and have drafted the data collection procedures. We are currently working on submitting [registered reports](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports) for this project ahead of data collection. If you are interested in joining the project, please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
