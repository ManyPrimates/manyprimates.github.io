## In progress

The third ManyPrimates project will assess primates' ability to make choices by excluding alternative options. We have assembled a coordination team, have drafted the data collection procedures, and are currently working on submitting a [registered report](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports) for this study. If you are interested in joining the project, please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
