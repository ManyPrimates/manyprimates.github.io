## The evolution of short-term memory

<strong>This paper has now been submitted for publication! Find the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/5etnf">preprint here.</a></strong>

The first ManyPrimates project is a continuation of our [pilot study](/pilot). We collected data from 400+ primates from 40+ species and almost 30 sites in order to make meaningful inferences about the evolution of short-term memory abilities in the primate lineage.
